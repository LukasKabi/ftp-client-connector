# FtpClient Anypoint Connector

The ftp-client-connector is an alternative implementation to the ftp and sftp connectors within Mule 3.x. It supports several features missing from the connector provided by MuleSoft:

1. Additional to polling, you can read files from the middle of a flow (given directory/name)
1. Delete files
1. List files in a directory
1. Poll with "ok file handling": Wait for file x and y, then read y
